I have been a professional software developer for four months now. I work as a JavaScript/Angular Developer for a London product company. The work is challenging and the most fulfilling job I've ever had. Unlike previous roles that were just a job -- something I would do between 9 and 5 every day -- being a software developer is a way of life characterised by a [growth mindset](https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/). This mindset values challenge and causes one to pursue interesting and challenging tasks as a way to learn more.

Coding is immensely difficult. It isn't hard to do in the way people think of physics and maths are hard. While there are certainly some circumstances where complex algorithms are necessary, day-to-day coding involves simpler patterns. The challenge of coding is the myriad aspects of a modern application that must be considered.  Professional software development teams typically divide the work between three teams -- front end, back end, and development operations (more about these in another post). But the test of a new developer's skill is to find and complete a project that encompasses all of the tasks of modern software development. Taking such a project from conception to go live is a tremendous learning opportunity. It proves to potential employers and the developer that (s)he can learn new technologies, implement them in an elegant and succinct manner, and create an useable application.

Fortunately for me, I have such an opportunity.

## The Project
A family member provides productivity coaching (i.e. "life coaching") services to those seeking higher levels of accomplishment. In her practice, she has developed a system for creating and tracking goals and tasks that support a client's achievements. The current system is charted using a spreadsheet in which the client enters their goals, the tasks to be completed, and completion dates for each. This system, while reported by clients to be helpful, does not provide the level of coaching interaction desired by the coach.  Specifically,

* the data entered in the spreadsheet is not easily shared with the coach;
* the coach is unable to, in real time, be notified of changes to the data;
* the client cannot easily add dates and times to a calendar for the goals and tasks;
* the coach cannot interact with the client regarding the data's content;
* the coach and the client are not notified when goals and tasks are approaching their due dates or have surpassed their due dates.

These five deficiencies are my understanding of the motivation behind creating an application for this service.

The application's functionality requirements, drawn from the deficiencies, touch on practically all domains of modern application design.  This makes the project an ideal one for applying existing knowledge and learning new technologies to satisfy the requirements.

What's next is to articulate the requirements as user stories and select the technology stack I'll use to build the application.
